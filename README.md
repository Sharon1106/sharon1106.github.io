#HW-2:html-css-code-portfolio
##Description:
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
For this assignment i created a portfolio. The portfolio includes a header with navigating links to sections within the same page. The sit contains an about me section, a section where they can view their applications. And a contact me section. 
```
###Issues
I had issues adjusting the grid and stacking the boxes in them is neat rows after a large image for the main work section.
I also had issues adding images to the grid boxes without the pictures being oversized.
