# HW-2:html-css-code-portfolio
## Description
For this assignment I created my portfolio. The portfolio includes a header with navigating links to sections within the same page. It contains an about me section, a section where you can view my applications. And a contact me section. 
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


### Issues
I had issues adjusting the grid and stacking the boxes in them is neat rows after a large image for the main work section.
I also had issues adding images to the grid boxes without the pictures being oversized. Using pure css and html for this assignment was tricky for me. THe grid layout is something to get used to. 

#### A work in progress...
